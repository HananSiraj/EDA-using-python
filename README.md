# EDA-using-python
This is a project based on Exploratory Data Analysis of a dataset related to employees working on ABC Company.In this project by using Exploratory Data Analysis we summarize and analyze the main characteristics of employee data set and to create a visual representation.First of all we have to Import all the required libraries like pandas,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib etc.since the data is already given the  data set is downloaded in csv format and then read the path of the excel file .This is done to create the DataFrame of the given dataset.The Data set consist of 458 instances and 9 features also called as rows and columns.Preprocessing is a key step in EDA it is used to change raw data into clean dataset like the column height is having incorrect data, changing the data of that particular column with any random numbers between 150 and 180.we also found the null values,dimensions,mean,mode,median,quartile of the dataset and also found if there is any duplicated data in the dataframe.After preprocessing we analyse number of employees present in each team and percentage splitting with respect to the total employees.After analysing we created a piechart to demonstrate its value visually.Next is to Segregate the employees w.r.t different positions and created a bar graph from the obtained output.After that we found which age group most of the employees belong to and used those data to create a scatterplot to display visually,here most employees belong to the age categorey 24.Later,we determined which team and position spending in terms of salary is high.then plotted the above data using boxplot which illustrate the relationship between team,position and salary.Finally,we analyzed if there is any correlation between age and salary of the employees and represented it using Heatmap which is a two dimensional representation of data.Overall in this project by using exploratory data analysis we processed the given dataset by undergoing various steps such as preprocessing and analyzing Team distribution,Salary expenditures w.r.t different position,Age group identificaion,Most salary spending team also,Correlation between age and salary with detailed visual presentations by using relevant data of ABC COMPANY.
